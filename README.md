# ConvexHull Algorithm for Computation Geometry
Author: Alberto Scicali

### How to run
In the `Assignment_1` folder, run the command 
```dotnet run Program.cs {arg1} {arg2}```
{arg1} can either be `0` - Brute Force Algorithm or `1` - Graham Scan Algorithm
{arg2} is the name of the input file, i.e. `inputFile.txt`

### Examples
Running the Brute Force Algorithm with the input file named `inputFileExample.txt`:
```dotnet run Program.cs 0 inputFileExample.txt```

Running the Graham Scan Algorithm with the input file names `inputFileExample.txt`:
```dotnet run Program.cs 1 inputFileExample.txt```
